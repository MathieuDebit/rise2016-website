    quote: "I feel extremely honoured to be given the chance to preside an International Session, and I feel extremely fulfilled to be given the chance to preside RISE 2016. In Rennes there will be no room for meaningless buzzwords, or useless special effects. We will concretely try to make use of this diversity, by applying to new contexts the techniques we master, and by developing new practices for the areas where we need to improve. What better place to ‘reinvent’ our organisation than France, the country where EYP was founded in 1987?"
