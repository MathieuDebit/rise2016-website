    content: "RISE 2016 is the 4th International Session hosted and organised in France. As flagship events of the European Youth Parliament, International Sessions bring together over <strong>300 young people</strong> coming from the 39 European countries of the EYP network for ten days. <br><br>This event will be one of a kind through its scale and <strong>international openness</strong>, but also through its theme enliven by several activities. <strong>Diversity</strong> and all its variations will be in the spotlight in July 2016. Therefore, 25% of delegates joining the 82nd International Session will be young European people who have never taken part in an EYP event. Whether they be young professionals or students, these participants will be selected on several criteria set by the organizers and the national EYP committees, in the hope of gathering a pioneering and talented audience. For the first time in the EYP, a session will have three official languages: English, German and French. Cultural, culinary, political or artistic diversity, diversity of experiences… Everything will be done to honour the European Union’s motto “United in diversity”."
    quote: "I feel extremely honoured to be given the chance to preside an International Session, and I feel extremely fulfilled to be given the chance to preside RISE 2016. In Rennes there will be no room for meaningless buzzwords, or useless special effects. We will concretely try to make use of this diversity, by applying to new contexts the techniques we master, and by developing new practices for the areas where we need to improve. What better place to ‘reinvent’ our organisation than France, the country where EYP was founded in 1987?"
